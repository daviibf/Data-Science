# Data Analysis for Traffic in Sao Paulo

In this notebook I've used some techniques of parallel Processing and Data Visualization for the Traffic analysis in the city of SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil.

The data set used consists of the results of several speed cameras scattered throughout the city.

Techniques:
 - Parallel Processing with Dask (Big Data)
 - NAN values treatment
 - Data Analysis
 - SQL
